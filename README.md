## üìö Description

The database includes the following tables:
- `Employee`
- `Department`
- `Project`
- `Works_for`
- `Dependent`

The project covers:
- Table creation and relationship constraints
- Populating tables with initial data
- Writing SQL queries to retrieve, update, and delete records
- Handling referential integrity and relational joins
- Solving business-specific logic (e.g., managers with no dependents)

## ‚ö† Notes

- This lab was built using **Microsoft Access**, so some SQL syntax is slightly different from MySQL/PostgreSQL.
- Pay attention to field data types and relationships when importing or modifying data.

## ‚úÖ Usage

1. Open `company-database.accdb` in Microsoft Access (if included).
2. Alternatively, copy and paste the SQL files into Access's SQL view in the Query Design tool.
3. Check the `queries/` folder for ready-to-run query solutions.
